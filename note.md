#### Intro:
The path planning is one of the key issues of autonomous vehicle. In this paper, a behavior-based method is used for path planning. This method can manage complexity environment and is easy to design and test behaviors. An autonomous electric vehicle is tested in a driving course including the behaviors of road following, turning, obstacle avoidance and emergency braking. The test results show that the path planning algorithm can run in a real-time, while the unknown obstacles can be avoided and the autonomous vehicle can be driven toward the destination in a smooth path and continuous motion.
